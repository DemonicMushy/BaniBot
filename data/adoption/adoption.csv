Applications to adopt a child from PRC must be made through agencies accredited by MSF and the Ministry of Civil Affairs of PRC. The agencies accredited by MSF are TOUCH Family Services Ltd and Fei Yue Community Services.

When identifying a child to adopt, you must ensure that the child is not trafficked, or illegally brought into Singapore for adoption, and you have the consent of the child's parents to adopt the child.

Please refer to the Adoption portal for the full procedure to adopt a foreign child."

I am a foreigner married to a Singapore citizen. Why do I have to adopt my stepchild when my spouse is the biological parent?,"If you are a foreigner married to a Singapore citizen, you have no parental rights over your stepchild even though you are married to the child’s biological parent. Hence, there is no legal relationship between you and the child. By jointly adopting the child, you can legalise your relationship with the child. 

However, adopting the child is still your personal decision. 

Please visit the 'Who Can Adopt' page on the Adoption Portal for more information."
My spouse is on a social visit pass. I wished to apply for citizenship for my stepchild but was told that I need to adopt the child first. How do I adopt?,"If the child is from the People’s Republic of China or PRC, your wife does not meet the requirements for adoption. 

If you wish to adopt your non-Singaporean stepchild, you should first consult a lawyer on whether your spouse meets the residency requirement stated in the Adoption of Children Act. After which, you may request for a waiver of the Home Study Report by writing to us through this form for our assessment if you are a Singapore citizen. 

Also, adoption only legalises your relationship with the child. You will have to separately apply for citizenship for the child after receiving the adoption order."
"After I apply to Court, why must I go through the Home Study Report and the assessment by MSF?","The purpose of a Home Study Report or HSR is to ensure that you are able to care for a child before the child stays with you during the adoption proceedings. 

A social investigation is then conducted when the Court appoints MSF as the child's Guardian-in-Adoption. MSF has a responsibility to safeguard the best interests of the child. MSF will assess how you and the child are adjusting to each other, and how you and your spouse are coping with the additional responsibility."
Can a child be adopted without the consent of his biological parents and caregivers?,"You must obtain the notarised consent from both of the child’s biological parents before applying to adopt the child. If you are unable to obtain the parental consent for various reasons, in your application to the Court, the other birth parent will need to put up an affidavit to explain the reasons for the Court’s consideration to dispense parental consent."
Can I include my name in my adopted child’s birth certificate?,"If you wish to include your name in your adopted child’s birth certificate, you may apply to change his or her name in your adoption application. Once the Adoption Order is granted by the Courts, your adopted child may take on the new name in his or her birth certificate and later, the NRIC."

If you are adopting a foreign child, you will first need to complete a Home Study Report or HSR. You need to have a favourable Home Study Report (HSR) before you identify a child for adoption. A HSR will take about 5 weeks to complete.

If you are ready to adopt another child, you are required to do a post-adoption report with an accredited agency. The report will provide an update on your circumstances, and an assessment of the adopted child’s welfare, parent-child bond, and your readiness to adopt another child.

In other words, the child must be your niece or nephew whose parent is your sibling or cousin.
