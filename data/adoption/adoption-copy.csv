I am a foreigner married to a Singapore citizen.

MSF will assess how you and the child are adjusting to each other, and how you and your spouse are coping with the additional responsibility."
Can a child be adopted without the consent of his biological parents and caregivers?,"You must obtain the notarised consent from both of the child’s biological parents before applying to adopt the child. If you are unable to obtain the parental consent for various reasons, in your application to the Court, the other birth parent will need to put up an affidavit to explain the reasons for the Court’s consideration to dispense parental consent."
Can I include my name in my adopted child’s birth certificate?,"If you wish to include your name in your adopted child’s birth certificate, you may apply to change his or her name in your adoption application.
