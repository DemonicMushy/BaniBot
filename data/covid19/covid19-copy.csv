 * Similar to the COVID-19 Support Grant to help cover basic expenses, the training allowances from the SGUP-CT or SGUS programmes are intended to help cover basic expenses incurred by the trainees over the duration of their training and were determined having considered the income relief support rates of other schemes such as the COVID-19 Support Grant and SIRS. The quantum is higher than under the Support Grant and SIRS in recognition of the training commitment involved."
Will recipients of existing subsidies and grants such as COVID-19 Support Grant be allowed to take part in the SGUnited Skills Programme and SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways Programme - Company Training?," * Recipients of the COVID-19 Support Grant may participate in the SGUnited Skills or the SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways Programme - Company Training to enhance their employability, and they will continue to receive their CSG pay-outs.

Those who are newly placed on ComCare will receive at least six months of assistance1.1 Some household may receive assistance for a shorter duration, if it is ascertained that within the next six months, they would be receiving other sources of income which they could tap on for their basic living expenses."
"If an applicant has been unemployed prior to COVID-19, can he/she apply for the COVID-19 Support Grant?","No, the applicant would not be eligible for the COVID-19 Support Grant as the grant supports those who are retrenched, placed on more than three months NPL or experienced at least 30% reduction in salary for more than 3 months, because of COVID-19.Those who have been unemployed prior to COVID-19 and require financial assistance may approach their nearest SSOs (go.gov.sg/locate-sso) to apply for financial assistance.ComCare provides financial assistance and comprehensive support to low-income individuals and families (with monthly household income of $1,900 and below, or a per capita income of $650 and below).

This covers about nine in 10 owner-occupied residential public and private properties and is consistent with other assistance schemes.

 * The COVID-19 Support Grant is intended to support lower- and middle-income households with greater needs. APV is used as a proxy for wealth and family support, as income rarely captures the entire range of resources an individual can tap on. Applicants who live in properties with higher APV generally have more means and resources (e.g. family support) than those living in a property with lower APV.

 * Other recent schemes such as the Solidarity Utilities Credit were given to all Singaporean households to extend additional support to as many citizens as possible during this challenging period.

 * Those who are unable to afford basic living expenses may approach their nearest SSOs (go.gov.sg/locate-sso) to apply for ComCare financial assistance. ComCare provides financial assistance and comprehensive support to low-income individuals and families (with monthly household income of $1,900 and below, or a per capita income of $650 and below, with no criterion on APV). If their income exceeds these guidelines but they face difficulties with basic living expenses, they may still approach the SSOs. The SSOs will assess their circumstances and needs, and provide assistance accordingly."
Can Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents who live overseas apply for the COVID-19 Support Grant?," * Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents who live overseas but have a Singapore address on their NRIC can apply for the grant if they meet all the eligibility criteria.

When can one apply for the extended COVID-19 Support Grant?," * Individuals may continue to apply for the COVID-19 Support Grant with the current eligibility criteria until 6pm on 30 Sep 2020. The revised eligibility criteria will take effect from 9am on 1 Oct 2020.

 * Existing COVID-19 Support Grant recipients who intend to apply for an additional three months of support can do so from 1 Oct 2020 only if they had received all three pay-outs before 1 Oct 2020, or are receiving their final month of COVID-19 Support Grant pay-out in Oct 2020.

Current COVID-19 Support Grant recipients can apply for the extended grant support, if they meet the revised eligibility criteria. However they can only apply if they are receiving their final month of assistance (i.e. if an applicant receives the COVID-19 Support Grant for Sep, Oct and Nov 2020 and requires additional assistance, they can apply again for the extended COVID-19 Support Grant earliest in the month of Nov 2020).

   - Applied/participated in job search or training programme under Workforce Singapore or the Employment and Employability Institute;
   - Applied/participated in training programme(s) supported by SkillsFuture Singapore; and/or
   - Applied/interviewed for jobs (at least one application/interview within the past two months preceding your CSG application"
"Are there other government schemes to support individuals who need additional financial support, but who are not eligible for the COVID-19 Support Grant (e.g. those who are still employed but earning low income)?","Low-income individuals can apply for ComCare assistance.ComCare provides financial assistance and comprehensive support to low-income individuals and families (with monthly household income of $1,900 and below, or a per capita income of $650 and below). If their income exceeds these guidelines, they may still approach the SSOs if they face financial difficulties. The SSOs will assess their circumstances and needs, and provide assistance accordingly."
How is the COVID-19 Support Grant different from ComCare Short-To-Medium-Term Assistance?,"For SCs/PRs who have lost their jobs or have been involuntarily placed on NPL, the COVID-19 Support Grant provides up to $800 in monthly cash assistance for three months and employment/training support.For SCs/PRs who had their salary reduced by least 30% due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation, the COVID-19 Support Grant provides up to $500 monthly cash assistance for three months.The ComCare Short-To-Medium-Term Assistance (SMTA) provides assistance for low-income and vulnerable households who require support for a temporary period due to various reasons including being unable to work due to illness or having to care for dependants. The amount and duration of SMTA varies across households depending on their needs, profile, and size. Assistance may include cash for daily living expenses, assistance with household bills, medical expenses and/or other support."
How can applicants verify the identity of a public servant contacting them through the phone or email?,"To make help more accessible, officers from the SSOs may conduct video/phone interviews with applicants to verify the identity and details of their applications. SSO officers will: * Identify themselves and purpose of the call and seek the applicant’s consent to proceed with the phone interview.
 * Contact applicants only if they have applied for financial assistance or the COVID-19 Support Grant, or sought financial help through other government agencies.
 * Provide applicants with an authorised email address xxx@msf.gov.sg to submit supporting documents.
 * Provide pre-paid envelopes for applicants to mail back the supporting documents for physical submissions. All applicants are strongly encouraged to mail the supporting documents. If they are unable to do so, they may physically bring the documents to the SSOs.

Alternatively, applicants can call the ComCare hotline number 1800-222-0000 to verify that an SSO Officer did indeed contact them. Our hotline team will email the relevant SSO for verification. An SSO Officer will contact the applicant and share the verified information (date and time of the applicant’s earlier call to the Comcare hotline as “proof”) and request for permission to proceed with the phone interview."
"Since the first tranche of CSG support is for three months, and the extension is for another three months, what happens if an employee needs more support beyond six months?","Households that need financial assistance for their basic living expenses can contact the Social Service Offices (SSOs) (go.gov.sg/locate-sso). Depending on their needs, SSOs can either provide them with ComCare assistance or link them up with other sources of community support."
Am I allowed to visit my boyfriend/ girlfriend or fiancé/fiancée or spouse living in a different house?,"Please do not do so during this period when circuit breaker measures are in place. The intention of these measures is to significantly reduce movements and social interactions to lower the risk of transmission across different households. You could consider using different digital means (e.g. video calls, phone calls, etc.) to keep in contact during this time."
Why are ROM services suspended from 7 Apr to 1 Jun 2020?,"ROM has suspended its services in line with the Government's major circuit breaker measures to battle the COVID-19 transmission. This is for the safety of the couples, their guests, as well as the community."
The ROM website indicates that all solemnisations between 7 Apr and 1 Jun will be rescheduled. When/How will we learn about our rescheduled solemnisation date?,"ROM will reschedule all appointments for verification of documents and solemnization of marriage, at ROM and external venues, scheduled during the circuit breaker. Our officers will be in touch with affected couples. We will waive all fees for changes due to the COVID-19 situation."
"My partner and I were notified by ROM that we will need to postpone our appointment with ROM and solemnisation, whether at ROM or external venues, until after 1 June. What is the reason for not allowing a maximum of 5 pax (solemniser, couple, 2 witnesses), if we comply with safe distancing rules?","Given the current COVID-19 situation, we strongly advise you to postpone your appointment for your own safety as well as that of your guests and solemniser. Circuit breaker measures have been introduced and everyone is to stay home. Contact is limited to immediate family members living in the same household during this period."
I am divorced and my children take turns to live with me and my ex-spouse. Can this arrangement continue?,"This is allowed. However, do keep changes and any movement and travel in this regard to a minimum, where possible, to lower the risk of transmission across different households."
"I am divorced/separated, and my spouse/ex-spouse has care and control of my child. Can face-to-face access arrangements continue during circuit breaker period?","Yes, face-to-face access arrangements are allowed, if these arrangements have been in place before the circuit breaker period. However, please keep movement and travel to a minimum to lower the risk of transmission across different households, given the latest measures put in place by the government."
"I am separated/ divorced, and Court had ordered Supervised Exchange/Supervised Visitation (SESV) services to assist me in having face-to-face contacts with my child. Can this arrangement continue?","From 2nd June onwards, Divorce Support Specialist Agencies (DSSAs) will be resuming services in phases. Safe management measures will be in place to safeguard the health and safety of all staff and clients. As part of DSSAs’ enhanced measures, SESV slots will be reduced. In lieu of this, DSSAs will offer remote access services via online platforms. DSSAs will be contacting their clients accordingly on the arrangements."
I am divorced/separated. What can I do if my ex-spouse and I disagree on access matters during this circuit breaker period?,"Parents are advised to facilitate continued access for their child and may wish to note that not doing so may result in a breach of the terms of their court order. Face-to-face access is still allowed with movement and travel kept to a minimum. Parents should co-operate with each other, and find practical and suitable solutions that serve the best interests of their children while complying with the circuit breaker measures. Co-parenting is important to enable children to continue to develop well. Studies show that acrimony between divorced parents can affect children adversely. Parents should therefore try to put aside their differences and make decisions in the best interests of their children. If there is mutual agreement, parents can also consider varying the arrangements or arranging access remotely through telephone, video calls or other online platforms. Parents who are still unable to reach an agreement may seek their own legal advice or email the Family Justice Courts Registry at fjcourts_family_registry@fjcourts.gov.sg for issues relating to custody and access. Turning to the court for the enforcement of access orders should be the last resort. Parents can seek counselling and emotional support during difficult times."

My child does not want to see my ex-spouse through face-to-face and/or remote access or talk to him/her on the phone. Must I still facilitate access?,Parents are strongly advised to facilitate continued access for their child. They should note that they could be breaching the terms of their court orders if they do not comply with existing orders.There are a variety of reasons why a child is reluctant to participate in access. You are encouraged to support your child by addressing his/her emotions regarding the access. It is important to show your child that you will support his/her access with your ex-spouse.Parents can seek counselling and emotional support during difficult times for themselves or their child.
My ex-spouse and I have agreed on remote access to protect our child and families from possible infection. How do I conduct remote access for my child?,"You can facilitate remote access through telephone, video calls or other available online platforms that you and your ex-spouse agree on. The parent with care and control of the child (care parent) will need to assist the child by setting up the session and encouraging the children to participate in the remote session with the access parent.Care parents are advised to provide some space for the child to interact independently with the access parent. For a younger child, aged 5 years old and below, the care parent may need to be physically around to assist the child but should allow the child to interact with the access parent without disruptions.Parents having access may find creative ways to connect with the child e.g. use online games. To complement remote access, parents may also encourage their child to send emails, letters or cards to access parents in order to stay in touch. The children may send appropriate pictures or videos of themselves to the access parent as well. The duration of the remote sessions will depend on the attention span and developmental stage of the child."
I am concerned about the safety of my child and would like to vary the court order for custody and/or access arrangements. Will I be able to do so in the circuit breaker and Phase 1 period?,"The courts will continue to conduct hearings, including applications to vary existing orders, with the appropriate safety measures in place. Please seek your own legal advice. Please refer to the Family Justice Courts'Registrar’s Circular No. 4 of 2020for more details."

"Are we allowed to go to the houses of our extended family for caregiving purposes (e.g., grandparents going to children's house to care for grandchildren, children bringing groceries/food for elderly parents who do not stay with them)?","The objective of the circuit breaker measures is to significantly reduce movements and social interactions, especially for seniors who are more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.

Grandparents can continue to care for their grandchildren if the grandchildren stay with them throughout this period. We strongly urge seniors to stay at home and avoid going out. You should not drop off your children with their grandparents on a daily basis as this increases the risk of transmission. However, exemptions can be made if you belong to one of the following groups:

 * Both parents are essential service workers and unable to work from home;

 * One parent is a healthcare professional (e.g. doctor, nurse, allied health professional, support care staff) and is unable to work from home; and

 * One parent is an essential service worker who is unable to work from home, and have a child/children below the age of three.

Individuals can still visit elderly family members to assist with their daily needs if there is no one else living with them who can do so. Where possible, we strongly recommend for family members to support their elderly relatives who do not stay with them by keeping in contact through phone or video calls, or bringing them groceries, food and other essential supplies to assist with their daily needs. This is to avoid seniors having to make trips out of the home for such activities.

Social gatherings, such as private parties and social get-togethers with friends and relatives and family members not within the same household, are disallowed."
"Can children still visit playgrounds or play in common areas such as HDB corridors, or condominium facilities?","No. Public playgrounds and condominium facilities, such as playgrounds, gyms and pools, will be closed. Children should also refrain from playing in common areas such as HDB corridors and void decks.

Children may visit public spaces around their immediate neighbourhood, for example public parks. They should do so only with members of their households. Safe distancing measures must be observed at all times.

Members of public are also advised to return to their homes promptly and not linger."
Can I move to stay in another household (e.g. my fiancé/fiancée or my child/ parent) in the middle of this circuit breaker period (e.g. on 15 April 2020) and remain in that household till the end of the circuit breaker period (i.e. 1 June 2020)?,"You should avoid doing so, to minimize the risk of transmission due to frequent interactions between households."
Can my day-time nanny caring for my child still come?,"No. Parents should suspend services of their day-time nannies so as to minimise the risk of transmission across different households. 

Parents are encouraged to care for their children within their own households. Employers are requested to exercise the necessary flexibility to support parents who are working from home during this time as having to care for their children personally might take a toll on their work productivity. 

To support our essential service workers we are allowing exemptions from the restriction for the following families who can continue to tap on the grandparents for childcare support on a daily basis:

 * Both parents are essential service workers and unable to work from home.

 * One parent is a healthcare professional (e.g. doctor, nurse, allied health professional , support care staff, etc) and is unable to work from from home.

 * One parent is an essential service worker who is unable to work from home and have a child/children below the age of three (this is in recognition that younger children are typically taken care of at home and need more attention).

Preschools will also continue to prioritise limited service provision for families without alternative care where:

 * Both parents are essential service workers (non-healthcare workers) or

 * One parent is a healthcare professional."
I find it difficult to work from home and take care of my child at the same time. I am also unable to find alternative child care arrangements. What can I do?,"The circuit breaker is an important public health measure to stem the spread of the COVID-19 virus and to safeguard the health all Singaporeans during this pandemic. It is in the best interest of your children and family to stay at home during this period.For parents working from home, we fully empathise that it can be challenging to juggle caring for our loved ones and maintaining the fullest commitment to our work. However, these are exceptional times and we each need to make adjustments to our lives to collectively curb the transmission of COVID-19. We need to limit the attendance in schools/preschools to reduce the risks of transmission. Employers are encouraged to exercise flexibility and understanding to employees during this period."
I'm a parent working in essential services. Can I continue to send my child to preschool?,"During the circuit breaker period, preschools remain open to serve a limited group of families. They remain open for families with no alternative caregiving arrangements and where (a) both parents are essential service workers (non-healthcare workers) working away from home or (b) one parent is a healthcare worker working away from home.Parents may contact their existing preschool if the child is already enrolled with a centre. If your child is not enrolled with a centre. If your child is not enrolled with a centre. If your child is not enrolled with a preschool, you can find one using ECDA's Preschool Search Portal (http://go.gov.sg/ecda-psp) and contact the centre directly."
I'm a parent working in essential services. Can my child continue attending a community-based student care centre?,"For parents who are both working in essential services (non-healthcare workers) and are unable to secure alternative care arrangements, you may approach your child's school or Special Education (SPED) school for assistance."
"Is my job considered ""essential services""?",You may refer to the list of essential services listed here:https://go.gov.sg/essential-services
My parents usually come over to help me with caring for my children on weekdays. Can we still do so?,"You should avoid doing so during this period, to minimise the risk of transmission, especially to elderly parents, due to frequent interactions between households.

Grandparents can continue to care for their grandchildren if the grandchildren stay with them throughout this period. They must remain in the same household throughout the period, as movement between households should be avoided to reduce the risk of transmission and to protect our seniors who are most vulnerable to COVID-19.

While most parents would be working from home, there would be some households where parents have to continue going to work during this period. These are workers in our essential services, especially our healthcare workers who are on the frontline working on shifts and on weekends, when childcare centres may not be available, and may be activated at any time of the day to respond to the COVID-19 situation. They will face additional difficulties which may be unnecessarily stressful for these essential service personnel. For very young children, we also recognise that it is difficult for them to be away from their parents for long periods of time, and adjusting to new caregivers that they are unfamiliar with would be challenging.

Therefore, we will be implementing exemptions for the following families, who may continue to tap on the grandparents for childcare support on a daily basis:

 * Both parents are essential service workers and unable to work from home;

 * One parent is a healthcare professional (e.g. doctor, nurse, allied health professional, support care staff) and is unable to work from home; and

 * One parent is an essential service worker who is unable to work from home, and have a child/children below the age of three.

Parents requiring assistance may contact ECDA at contact@ecda.gov.sg or 67359213.

Families who are relying on the grandparents for childcare on a daily basis are advised to take the necessary safe distancing precautions to protect the elderly. Observe personal hygiene and try to reduce interaction time as far as possible when visiting their home. Do not visit when unwell."
What supporting documents do I need to prove to my child's preschool/student care centre that I am working in essential services?,"Parents/guardians can provide carious forms of documentation, for example, a letter from your employer, your staff pass etc."
"Will parents working in essential services, who continue sending their children to preschool and student care centres, receive the 50% fee offset as well?",The fee offsets are only extended to Singaporean children not attending preschool and student care during the circuit breaker period.
I am experiencing high levels of stress during this circuit breaker period. Where can I seek help or respite?,"For those with general anxiety or stress, you may call the National CARE Hotline (Tel: 62026868) for support.For those experiencing marital or parenting stress, you may wish to contact CPH Online Counselling at www.cphonlinecounselling.sg.Live chat: Mon-Fri 9am-9pmFrom 13 Apr 2020, Sat 10am-2pm(except public holidays)Email: Anytime, counsellor will respond within 3 working days"
I suspect a child is being abused. How do I contact Child Protection?,"If you suspect that a child is abused in any way, please do not hesitate to contact one of the following to seek advice or help: * Child Protection Service Helpline (1800 777 0000)
 * HEART @ Fei Yue Child Protection Specialist Centre (6819 9170)
 * Big Love Child Protection Specialist Centre (6445 0400)
 * SAFE SPACE Child Protection Specialist Centre (6266 0171)

If there is an emergency where a child has been harmed or is in imminent danger, please call the Police at 999 immediately."
"Will all MSF services, programmes and facilities open in Phase 1?","MSF’s public services that were available during the circuit breaker (including our Social Service Offices (SSOs), Registry of Marriages) will continue with safe management measures in place.Come 2 June, we will reopen MSF-funded social services and programmes (including Family Service Centres, Day Activity Centres for persons with disabilities, Special Student Care Centres) safely in phases. In Phase 1, we will prioritise the reopening of critical services and those addressing higher needs. Safe management measures will be in place to safeguard the health and safety of all staff and clients, in particular for services delivered in the Centres, or through home visits."
How is MSF safeguarding the health and safety of people who turn up at Social Service Offices and other frontline services?,"MSF-funded services and Centres are required to put in place safe management measures to ensure:> i.Individuals who may pose a risk of transmission are not allowed into the premises ii.Minimal interaction/mixing between staff and clients from different zones/teams, so as to minimise risk of cross-transmission in the event of a confirmed COVID-19 case in Centresiii.Staff and clients adopt safe behaviour to reduce the risk of transmission and ensure a safe environment within Centres.
Some of these measures include temperature screening and health checks for all staff, clients and visitors arriving at the Centre, stepping up disinfection of frequently touched surfaces and spacing out the seats in interview rooms and service counters in Centres at least one metre apart. As an added precaution for service counters, desk shields or plastic dividers will be used to keep our clients and staff safe. Group work/activities will also be suspended until further notice to limit social mixing across different households."
Will more Social Service Agencies (SSA) volunteers be allowed to operate and interact with vulnerable families during Phase 1 post-circuit breaker?,"Volunteers may be required to support Social Service Agencies (SSAs) in service provision. Activities involving regular volunteers who perform essential and routine functions can continue. They should be regarded and managed as staff with the necessary precautions taken. Activities involving ad-hoc volunteers who perform non-essential functions, or who might be in close contact with vulnerable groups, should be suspended. To protect the more vulnerable elderly residents, we will continue to disallow volunteers from entering Homes serving elderly residents."
It was previously announced that staff serving elderly residents in Homes will move on-site or to hotels during the circuit breaker period. Will staff serving elderly residents continue to stay onsite/hotels after the circuit breaker lifts?,"From 2 June, most of the staff will return to their own places of residence. Some staff require time to make adjustments to their living arrangements to minimise the risk of cross-infections, such as those who share accommodation with other individuals serving in other elderly homes.These staff may continue staying onsite at the Homes or in hotels for a few more weeks while they secure new living arrangements.As all our staff working at these Homes continue to be in regular close contact with residents, they should refrain from going out, except for essential needs."
Can all Social Service Agencies (SSAs) resume services in Phase 1 following the circuit breaker?,"From 2 June 2020, Social Service Agencies (SSAs) can only serve high-needs clients and provide critical services with minimal staff onsite with safe management measures in place. If urgent/critical face-to-face contact is needed, shorter interaction times with safe distancing measures should be observed.SSAs and community groups distributing essential aid (e.g. cooked food and urgent financial aid) to vulnerable persons and families may continue their activities. However, to avoid a resurgence of community cases, SSAs and community groups providing aid are strongly encouraged to limit their activities to cases in need of urgent aid and essential supplies, and to take necessary precautions."
What criteria do SSAs and community groups have to fulfil for their services or activities to be considered ‘urgent aid and essential supplies’?,"Essential aid refers to supplies necessary for daily sustenance, such as cooked food, food rations, and urgent financial aid. SSAs must be serving an essential and urgent need that is not already being met, and comply with the precautionary measures detailed in our advisory before NCSS can consider approving their activities. NCSS will also take into consideration the geographical distribution of SSAs and their beneficiaries, to ensure that the delivery of essential aid is coordinated and the vulnerable are adequately served. Groups also need to demonstrate strict safe distancing measures in their plans (e.g. no social mixing among different groups of staff/volunteers, reduced number of people and duration of physical interactions with beneficiaries). Details can be found in the 26 May advisory on essential aid distribution."
"If my SSA was previously whitelisted to provide essential aid, do I need to go back to NCSS to seek approval on my distribution plans to continue operations?","Yes, agencies previously whitelisted should continue to seek NCSS’ approval during Phase 1, as distribution plans would likely be different from what was approved during the circuit breaker (e.g. dates, frequency, service users, volunteers)."
How long will the consideration/review process take for services/activities to be approved?,SSAs and groups distributing essential aid that need to engage in face-to-face intervention for urgent or at-risk cases should plan the modality of essential aid distribution to adhere with strict safe management measures. These plans should be submitted to NCSS at www.go.gov.sg/distributioncontact at least 3 working days before SSAs/ community groups commence planning and/or conducting any distribution activities. NCSS will respond within 3 working days.
What happens if SSAs and community groups do not comply with the advisory and continue their activities without seeking NCSS’ approval?,"The precautionary measures are in place to stem community transmission of COVID-19 by resuming activities in a gradual and safe manner. We ask for the understanding and support of all SSAs to comply during this period, and approach NCSS for approval before continuing with their essential aid activities. Through everyone’s cooperation, we will be able to ensure that essential aid continues to be provided to the vulnerable in a safe manner."
Will social enterprises and ground-up groups be allowed to operate?,"Social enterprises and registered ground-up groups should ensure that they are exempted by MTI to resume onsite operations. In addition, they need to seek approval from NCSS to carry out essential aid distribution."
How will NCSS help organisations to refine their plans before getting approval? What further help do they need even after they have declared they are able to comply with the precautionary measures?,"NCSS will work closely with SSAs and community groups to optimise their operations so that they can continue to deliver essential aid to those in need, in a way that ensures the safety of beneficiaries, staff and volunteers. SSAs and community groups will be required to comply with precautionary and safe management measures."
"If I previously received a time-limited permit, do I have a higher chance of getting NCSS’ approval for my new distribution plans?","Agencies previously whitelisted or received time-limited permit should continue to seek NCSS’ approval during Phase 1, as distribution plans would likely be different from what was approved during the circuit breaker (e.g. dates, frequency, service users, volunteers etc)."
"A limited number of selected senior care centres, day rehab centres, psychiatric rehabilitation centres, and day hospices will remain open to support those with inadequate family support, as well as intensive care needs. How do I ask for permission to continue sending my family members to these centres?",Please ask your existing centre-based care provider to make an application on your behalf to the Agency of Integrated Care (AIC).
Can I still accompany my elderly parent living in a different household to medical appointments or to purchase essential supplies?,"Yes, you can continue to accompany your elderly parent to medical appointments if there are no other alternatives (such as deferring non-essential appointments) but please take additional precautions such as wearing a mask and ensuring good personal hygiene while you are in contact with him or her.

As for purchase of essential supplies, we strongly recommend for family members to support their elderly relatives who do not stay with them by bringing them groceries, food and daily necessities. This is to avoid seniors having to make trips out of the home for such activities. Seniors should stay at home as far as possible."
"Can I still check on my neighbour who is a senior? She is living alone with no kin, and usually comes to our house for dinner.","Yes, you may continue to provide assistance to her for her daily needs, but unless absolutely necessary, this should not be done with physical interaction. If you have any physical interaction, please take the necessary safe distancing precautions, such as observing personal hygiene and ensuring your hands are clean, minimising physical contact and maintaining a safe separation as much as possible. Do not visit if you are unwell.

If you know of a senior e.g. neighbour, friend, family member, who needs assistance with their daily needs, please contact the AIC hotline at 1800-650-6060."
Home personal care will be scaled down to serve only seniors with inadequate family support. How do I apply for continuation of service for these seniors?,"Home personal care will be available for seniors who live alone, or seniors who live only with another frail person or person with disability, or if the senior’s only caregiver is an essential service worker. If you know of seniors in such a situation you may apply for continuation of service through the senior’s existing home personal care provider, or call the AIC hotline at 1800-650-6060."
"If I am a volunteer delivering food to seniors and vulnerable groups, am I allowed to continue? If I stop, who will take care of these vulnerable persons?","It is far preferable to stop this at an individual level, as you will be coming into contact with other people, and then with the seniors and vulnerable persons. However, organisations and groups distributing essential aid (e.g. food) to vulnerable persons and families are allowed to continue their activities, but these should be limited to critical aid and supplies, and the necessary precautions must be taken. MSF’s advisory on Essential Aid Distribution (8 Apr 2020) provides more details (available at www.msf.gov.sg/media-room/Pages/COVID-19-advisory.aspx).

Please check with your host organisation whether it has been pre-cleared to continue with its activities. Per MSF’s advisory, if you are an organisation or group seeking to provide such services, please submit the necessary information to the National Council of Social Services (NCSS). MOH-subvented providers for meal deliveries do not need to submit additional information to NCSS.

For persons who are unable to buy or prepare food on their own, please contact the AIC Hotline at 1800-650-6060 for referral to a meal delivery service.

All other organisations/ groups providing aid are encouraged to engage known aid recipients remotely (via telephone, online, video-conference). This includes befriending services to check on the well-being of the elderly."
"My parent lives alone but does not require assistance with daily needs. However, I am afraid that he/she will get lonely as he/she is unable to spend time with friends at the coffeeshop/ community centre/ Senior Activity Centre during this period. Can I visit him/her from time-to-time?","To protect our seniors, we should minimise face-to-face interaction where possible. You may wish to contact him/her via the phone or video call instead, and encourage him/her to stay active by doing exercises at home, some of which can be accessed via the TV and online programmes which have been put in place for seniors.

You can also check in on him/her when you help to bring over groceries, food and daily necessities, but try to reduce interaction time as far as possible. Please take the necessary safe distancing precautions while you are there, such as observing personal hygiene and ensuring your hands are clean, minimising physical contact and maintaining a safe separation as much as possible. Do not visit if you are unwell.

We understand that this is a difficult adjustment for many families, and these measures go against our instinct to want to demonstrate frequent care and attention to our loved ones. But the elderly and vulnerable are most susceptible to severe COVID-19 infection, and we should refrain from exposing them to the risk of COVID-19 as far as possible by minimising physical interactions with them."
