We use broad definitions for the groups we seek to help, have clear criteria to identify and assess those in need, and tailor schemes to assist them. Our assessment process is rigorous but also flexible to cater to the genuinely needy. Singaporeans who do not meet the scheme criteria but who still deserve help, can receive assistance.

There will always be a segment of our society who are vulnerable, and despite their best efforts, need help to cope. The Government is committed to do more to help them. We will continue to review our assistance schemes regularly so that they remain relevant. We will also continue to develop different indicators to improve our understanding of the numbers and needs of low income families in Singapore.

The Government cannot do this alone. We will work with community organisations and kind-hearted Singaporeans who have been playing a crucial role in helping the needy in Singapore."
